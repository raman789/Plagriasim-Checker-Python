If we do a regular JOIN (with none of the keywords INNER, OUTER, LEFT or RIGHT), then we get all 
records that match in the appropriate way in the two tables, and records in both incoming tables that 
do not match are not reported:
mysql> select name, phone, selling from demo_people join demo_property on
demo_people.pid = demo_property.pid;
If we do a LEFT JOIN, we get all records that match in the same way and IN ADDITION we get an extra 
record for each unmatched record in the left table of the join - thus ensuring that every PERSON gets a 
mention:
mysql> select name, phone, selling from demo_people left join demo_property
on demo_people.pid = demo_property.pid;
If we do a RIGHT JOIN, we get all the records that match and IN ADDITION we get an extra record for 
each unmatched record in the right table of the join - in example, that means that each property gets a 
mention even if we don't have seller details:
mysql> select name, phone, selling from demo_people right join demo_property
on demo_people.pid = demo_property.pid;
An INNER JOIN does a full join, just like the first example, and the word OUTER may be added
after the word LEFT or RIGHT in the last two examples - it's provided for ODBC compatibility
and doesn't add an extra capabilities.
